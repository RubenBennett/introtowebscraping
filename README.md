## Intro to webscraping

This is just an annotated line of code in Rscript that details my first successful attempt at building a webscraper.

The code will scrape the UK Judiciary websites prevention of future deaths reports for drug and alcohol related deaths, downloading all of them into a new data folder.

This is more here for me to look back on when I need it, really - still very new to this.
